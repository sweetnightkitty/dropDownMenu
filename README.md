## How to use this dropdown
The entire nav bar can be used as is, or if you only want the dropdown menu the start and end of the dropdown menu is marked with comments so that you can easily remove the content above and below it.

### Option 1
You do not want/need to change the class names on the dropdown menu:

*  Do nothing and the JS will work as is!

### Option 2
If you want to change the class names in accordance with your project:

* Make sure to assign a unique class name to the dropdown button, the div that contains the dropdown content.
* Assign the SAME class for all the dropdown links.
* In index.js update the const dropdownBtn, dropdownContent, and dropdownLinks to target the respective classes you created.
